"alsi.logo2" is an alternative Alsi logo which is IMHO more "Arch-like" than those provided by Alsi or archey. The colors are set to match my "Olive Touch" subtle-WM theme, though.

To fill the empty trailing lines right of the logo, I manually added pseudo-functions and values indicating the locale, X input method, and others, as well as there is a bottom line with a slogan in German: "Arch Linux :: Eine flexible und leichtgewichtige Linux-Distribution."; you may want to edit these. -- Example screenshot: http://mitoxd.deviantart.com/art/Olive-Alsi-398992389

Just copy "alsi.logo2" to your ~/.config/alsi/ directory, load it with the "-f" option, or declare it as default logo in alsi.conf.

Note: For the similar looking /etc/issue in Arch-blue colors, look for my "Arch-blueissue" remote.


Have fun! ^^
